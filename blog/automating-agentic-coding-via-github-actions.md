# Automating Agentic Coding via GitHub Actions

The landscape of software development is rapidly evolving with the integration of AI agents into our workflows. While much attention has been focused on AI coding assistants within IDEs (like Cursor) or standalone application development tools (like V0 and Replit), there's another powerful frontier that hasn't received enough attention: **automation of coding tasks through AI agents in CI/CD pipelines**.

This post explores how MyCoder, an AI-powered coding assistant that runs on the command line, can be integrated into GitHub Actions to automate various aspects of the development workflow.

## The Current State: MyCoder GitHub Action

MyCoder already includes a GitHub Action that allows it to respond to comments on GitHub issues and PRs. This integration is defined in the `.github/workflows/issue-comment.yml` file and is triggered whenever a comment containing `/mycoder` is posted.

Here's how it works:

1. A user posts a comment with `/mycoder [instructions]` on a GitHub issue or PR
2. The GitHub Action workflow is triggered
3. MyCoder runs with the context of the issue/PR and the specific instructions
4. MyCoder completes the requested task and reports back on the issue/PR

This simple integration demonstrates the power of agentic coding in automation. Instead of manually performing repetitive tasks, developers can delegate them to an AI agent right from within their GitHub workflow.

## Real-World Examples

Let me share a couple of recent examples where I used MyCoder's GitHub Action to implement features while multitasking in a rather unusual development environment - sitting on my sofa, listening to "Baby Shark" YouTube videos with my 2-year-old daughter during breakfast.

### Example 1: Multiple Line Custom Prompts (Issue #249 → PR #250)

In [Issue #249](https://github.com/drivecore/mycoder/issues/249), I identified a limitation in MyCoder's configuration: it only supported single-line custom prompts in the `mycoder.config.js` file. I posted a simple comment:

```
/mycoder can you turn this into a PR?
```

MyCoder analyzed the issue, understood the requirements, and implemented a solution that:
- Updated the configuration types to accept either a string or an array of strings
- Modified the system prompt generation to handle both formats
- Updated examples in the documentation
- Created [PR #250](https://github.com/drivecore/mycoder/pull/250) with a complete implementation

All of this happened automatically while I was helping my daughter with her breakfast.

### Example 2: Custom CLI Commands (Issue #251 → PR #252)

For a more complex feature, I created [Issue #251](https://github.com/drivecore/mycoder/issues/251) requesting the ability to define custom CLI commands in the configuration file. I started with:

```
/mycoder Can you have a look at this issue and create an implementation plan?
```

MyCoder responded with a comprehensive implementation plan that included extending the configuration types, creating command handlers, and providing examples. After reviewing the plan, I refined the requirements:

```
/mycoder this is a good plan. Let's only do the JavaScript command executor though and not the bare string, that simple form doesn't really accomplish much and adds complexity. Can you create a PR for this new feature?
```

MyCoder then created [PR #252](https://github.com/drivecore/mycoder/pull/252), implementing the custom CLI commands feature exactly as requested, with:
- Support for defining custom commands in `mycoder.config.js`
- Command arguments with validation
- JavaScript function-based command executors
- Comprehensive documentation

Both of these features were implemented without me writing a single line of code, all while I was in "parent mode" rather than "developer mode."

## The Untapped Potential of Agentic Automation

These examples only scratch the surface of what's possible when we integrate AI agents into our automation workflows. Here are some other potential applications:

### Automated Documentation Updates

Imagine a GitHub Action that runs on each PR to:
- Analyze code changes
- Update relevant documentation
- Generate new documentation for new features
- Ensure API references stay in sync with implementations

### Test Coverage Enhancement

A GitHub Action could:
- Analyze PRs for areas lacking test coverage
- Automatically generate appropriate tests
- Update test fixtures based on implementation changes
- Suggest test strategies for complex code paths

### Automated Code Reviews

Beyond simple linting, an agentic code reviewer could:
- Compare PR implementations against issue requirements
- Check for adherence to project-specific coding standards defined in `PR_REVIEW_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Identify potential performance issues
- Suggest architectural improvements
- Detect security vulnerabilities through semantic understanding

### Goal-Oriented Website Testing

Since MyCoder can navigate websites without hard-coded selectors:
- Automatically test user flows after UI changes
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Provide feedback on navigation usability
- Test responsive behavior across device sizes

### Codebase Maintenance

Automated agents could:
- Identify and refactor deprecated API usage
- Modernize code patterns
- Standardize code style across large codebases
- Detect and fix technical debt

## Beyond "Vibe Coding"

There's a common misconception that AI coding assistants are primarily useful for "vibe coders" or toy applications. The reality is that agentic coding, especially when integrated into automation workflows, can transform how enterprises and medium-sized businesses approach software development.

By automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency, and reducing manual overhead, agentic automation allows human developers to focus on higher-level architectural decisions, business logic, and innovation.

## Getting Started with MyCoder GitHub Actions

To integrate MyCoder into your GitHub workflow, you'll need:

1. The GitHub Action workflow file (`.github/workflows/issue-comment.yml`)
2. Appropriate API keys configured as GitHub secrets
3. MyCoder installed in your CI/CD environment

The basic workflow file looks something like this:

```yaml
name: MyCoder Issue Comment Action

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  # Other necessary permissions...

jobs:
  process-comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '/mycoder')
    steps:
      # Setup steps...
      
      - name: Run MyCoder
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          mycoder --githubMode true --userPrompt false "On issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} the user invoked mycoder via /mycoder. Please help them with their request."
```

## Conclusion

We've only begun to explore the potential of agentic coding automation. As AI models continue to improve, the range of tasks they can automate will expand dramatically. By integrating these agents into our CI/CD pipelines and GitHub workflows, we can create development environments that are more efficient, consistent, and focused on human creativity rather than repetitive tasks.

The future of software development isn't just about having an AI assistant in your IDE—it's about embedding intelligent agents throughout your entire development workflow, from issue creation to deployment and maintenance.

What repetitive development tasks would you like to automate with agentic coding? The possibilities are endless, and we've barely scratched the surface.

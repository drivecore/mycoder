# Solution to GitHub Issue #166: Improved Git Hooks Order

## Problem

The pre-commit hook was running tests and builds (taking 30+ seconds) before the commit-msg hook checked if the commit message was valid. This resulted in wasted time when a commit had an invalid message format.

## Solution

We've implemented a solution that ensures the commit message format is validated before running any time-consuming operations like tests and builds. This is achieved through the following changes:

1. Ensured the commit-msg hook is properly configured to validate commit messages using commitlint
2. Modified the pre-commit hook to focus on code quality checks without attempting to validate the commit message
3. Leveraged Git's hook execution order: commit-msg runs BEFORE pre-commit when using git commit -m

## Implementation Details

### 1. Commit-msg hook configuration

The commit-msg hook is properly configured to use commitlint to validate commit messages against the conventional commits standard. This hook runs before any expensive operations in the pre-commit hook.

### 2. Modified pre-commit hook

The pre-commit hook now focuses on code quality checks (linting, building, and testing) without attempting to validate the commit message format. This is because Git's hook execution order already ensures that the commit-msg hook runs first.

### 3. Understanding Git's hook execution order

When using `git commit`, Git executes hooks in this order:
1. prepare-commit-msg
2. commit-msg (validates the commit message)
3. pre-commit (runs linting, building, and testing)

This natural order ensures that commit message validation happens before expensive operations, saving developer time.

## Benefits

- Saves time by failing fast when commit messages don't meet the required format
- Provides immediate feedback to developers about commit message issues
- Maintains the same level of code quality checks
- Improves developer experience by reducing unnecessary wait times
- Uses Git's natural hook execution order rather than complex workarounds
